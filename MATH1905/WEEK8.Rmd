A new surgical procedure is said to be successful 80% of the time. Suppose that the operation
is performed 8 times, with the results being independent of each other. Let X be the number of
success of this operation.
(i) What particular type of distribution does the random variable X have? State the values of
the parameters.
(ii) Find the probabilities that (a) exactly three operations are successful; (b) fewer than five
operations are successful; and (c) more than three are successful.
(iii) What are the expected number and variance of the number of successes out of 8 operations?
